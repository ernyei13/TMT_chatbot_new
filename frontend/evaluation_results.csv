X-TC-8,What are the use cases of the APS?,0.6379829546080438,65,"The assistant's response provides a detailed explanation of several APS use cases, including post-segment exchange alignment, alignment of M1, M2, and M3 mirrors, off-axis wavefront measurements, and calibration of elevation dependence of M2 and M3. However, it misses many specific use cases listed in the reference answer, such as Acquisition, APS Pre-Session Calibration, Broad Band Phasing, Calibrate M1CS Edge Sensors, Calibration of Camera Pointing Offsets, Collect Reference Beam, M3 Alignment Procedure, Maintenance Alignment, Measurement of segment warping harness influence functions, Narrow Band Phasing, Rigid Body and Segment Figure correction, and Self Test. The response is clear and well-structured but lacks completeness and keyword coverage relative to the reference. The assistant also focuses heavily on the SysML model context, which is not directly requested and may reduce clarity for some readers. Overall, the answer is partially correct and clear but incomplete in covering all expected use cases.",0,0%
X-TC-9,What are the structural elements of the APS operational domain?,0.48484109611284265,95,"The response thoroughly covers the structural elements of the APS operational domain as requested, explicitly mentioning the aPS Mission, maintenance Team, external Environment, and external Constraints. It provides detailed context, references to diagrams, and explains the relationships and significance of these elements, demonstrating completeness and clarity. The only minor issue is a small typo in 'external Environmet' (missing 'n'), but this does not significantly impact understanding. Overall, the answer is correct, comprehensive, and clear, with excellent keyword coverage.",4,100%
X-TC-11,What other system components does the APS interface with?,0.5703924899406745,85,"The assistant's response provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the APS interfaces with various system components, including the Telescope Control System, M1 Control System, and software components like APS_PEAS. It clearly covers the key interfaces and their significance, supported by references to model elements and documentation. However, it does not explicitly mention 'APS User', 'Common Services', or 'Executive Software' as stated in the reference answer and expected keywords. The absence of these components slightly reduces completeness and keyword coverage. The clarity and correctness are high, and the response is well-structured and informative.",2,40%
X-TC-11,What are the structural elements of the APS mission?,0.5244067189246907,85,"The response provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the structural elements of the APS mission, referencing both the SysML model and the documentation. It covers the APS Mission blocks, assemblies, interfaces to control systems (including M1 and TCS), and behavioral elements supporting the structure. However, it does not explicitly mention all the expected keywords such as 'APS User', 'Common Services', 'Executive Software', and 'APS Operational Blackbox Specification JPL' in a clear, direct manner, though some are implied. The answer is clear and well-structured but could be more concise and directly aligned with the expected keywords for completeness.",2,33%
X-TC-11,What are the verified requirements of the APS?,0.5018449490761199,30,"The assistant's response provides a detailed overview of various APS requirements related to optical specifications, mechanical interfaces, and SysML model elements. However, it does not address any of the specific verified requirements listed in the reference answer, such as Peak Power Limit Requirement JPL, On-axis alignment maximum time for Post Segment Exchange JPL, Maintenance Alignment Maximum Time, M3 Alignment Maximum Time, Off-Axis Acquisition Maximum Time, Warping Harness Maximum Time, Self Test Maximum Time, or Telescope Pupil Alignment Requirement. The response is clear and well-structured but lacks correctness and completeness with respect to the question and expected keywords. Therefore, the score is low due to poor keyword coverage and missing key verified requirements.",0,0%
