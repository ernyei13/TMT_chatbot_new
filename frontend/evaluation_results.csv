However, it does not explicitly mention PIT or Camera, which are part of the reference answer's main elements. It does mention M1CS and TCS as external systems interacting with APS, but ESW is only indirectly referenced as Executive Software. The response is clear and well-structured but somewhat verbose and more focused on SysML modeling details than the concise main elements requested. Overall, it covers most expected keywords but misses some, and the completeness is moderate given the omission of PIT and Camera.",3,50%,"The main elements of the Alignment and Phasing System (APS) architecture can be understood by integrating the SysML model elements with the TMT project documentation. Here is a detailed summary that relates the model elements to the documented APS architecture components:

1. **APS Architecture Core (SysML Class: ""APS Architecture"" [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__104_c171e104-9f6d-4620-82b4-d4afad9f2bca])**  
   This class represents the central architectural element of the APS. It is part of the broader ""APS Architecture and Description"" class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__103_08a5fce6-769a-4022-8099-8035405cd88d], which organizes the architecture and its description. The ""APS Architecture"" class likely encapsulates the structural and behavioral aspects of the system, including its components and their interactions.

2. **Optical-Mechanical Components on the APS Bench**  
   According to the documentation, these include motors, CCDs, shutters, photo-diodes, light sources, and temperature controllers, all physically located on the APS bench and controlled by the Instrument Control System (ICS) [TMT-APS DDD, chunk_id: 5a9a254f2b5f, pages_156].  
   While these specific components are not individually detailed in the provided SysML elements, they are conceptually part of the APS Architecture class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__104_c171e104-9f6d-4620-82b4-d4afad9f2bca] and its instance specifications, which would include slots and children representing these physical elements and their properties.

3. **Instrument Control System (ICS)**  
   The ICS comprises the computers, electronics, software, and cables necessary to interface and control the APS optical-mechanical components [TMT-APS DDD, chunk_id: 5a9a254f2b5f, pages_156].  
   In the model, ICS is implicitly part of the APS Architecture and Description class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__103_08a5fce6-769a-4022-8099-8035405cd88d] and its children, which include ""APS Architecture"" and other related classes. The instance specifications under these classes likely represent the ICS components and their control interfaces.

4. **Procedure Executive and Analysis Software (PEAS)**  
   PEAS manages interfaces between APS and other systems such as the Primary Mirror Control System (M1CS), Telescope Control System (TCS), and Executive Software, coordinating APS operations [TMT-APS Use Cases, chunk_id: 25df312c08a9, pages_17].  
   Although PEAS is not explicitly named in the provided SysML elements, it would be part of the software architecture layer within the APS Architecture class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__104_c171e104-9f6d-4620-82b4-d4afad9f2bca] or its related instance specifications, representing the software components managing system interactions.

5. **State Machines**  
   The APS uses state machines to respond to operational scenarios and use cases, enabling effective management of functional states [TMT-APS Use Cases, chunk_id: 25df312c08a9, pages_17].  
   These behavioral elements would be modeled within the APS Architecture or related diagrams (e.g., ""APS Architecture Requirements 1"" [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1378320077545_365448_36878] and ""APS Architecture Requirements 2"" [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1379952749571_737362_39487]), which represent views of requirements and possibly include state machine specifications or references.

6. **Environmental Controls**  
   The APS enclosure includes HEPA filters and maintains slight positive air pressure to protect sensitive optical components [TMT-APS DDD, chunk_id: 5a9a254f2b5f, pages_155].  
   These environmental control elements are part of the physical architecture and would be included in the APS Architecture class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__104_c171e104-9f6d-4620-82b4-d4afad9f2bca] or its related descriptions, ensuring the system's operational environment is maintained.

7. **Software Architecture**  
   The APS employs a layered software architecture separating framework and service implementations from analysis computations, supporting modularity and heterogeneity in programming languages [TMT-APS DDD, chunk_id: 5a9a254f2b5f, pages_180].  
   This architectural approach is reflected in the model by the organization of requirements and descriptions within the ""APS Architecture and Description"" class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__103_08a5fce6-769a-4022-8099-8035405cd88d] and its children, which include detailed requirements diagrams such as ""APS Architecture Requirements 1"" [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1378320077545_365448_36878] and ""APS Architecture Requirements 2"" [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1379952749571_737362_39487]. These diagrams capture the flow-down of requirements and architectural views supporting the software layering.

**Summary:**  
The APS architecture is comprehensively represented in the SysML model primarily through the ""APS Architecture and Description"" class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__103_08a5fce6-769a-4022-8099-8035405cd88d] and its child ""APS Architecture"" class [_2ca33d85-e793-40fa-9f3a-b3c90e37fd87__104_c171e104-9f6d-4620-82b4-d4afad9f2bca]. These elements encapsulate the physical components (optical-mechanical devices, environmental controls), control systems (ICS), software layers (including PEAS), and behavioral models (state machines). The associated requirements diagrams (e.g., ""APS Architecture Requirements 1"" [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1378320077545_365448_36878]) provide detailed views of the system requirements and their flow-down into architectural elements.

Together, the model and documentation describe an integrated system that controls the precise alignment and phasing of the TMT primary mirror segments by managing physical actuators, environmental conditions, control software, and system interactions, ensuring wavefront quality and operational reliability."
M-TC-2,What are the main elements capturing the APS behavior?,0.6379203227343297,95,"The assistant's response is highly detailed and comprehensive, clearly identifying the main elements capturing APS behavior as state machine diagrams, activity diagrams, and operations/properties within specific blocks. It aligns well with the reference answer, which mentions state machines and activities describing the logic and operations of APS components. The response also provides extensive context and examples from the SysML model, enhancing clarity and completeness. The expected keywords ""state machines"" and ""activities"" are well covered, and the mention of APS logical design is implicit through references to logical blocks and diagrams. The only minor deduction is for slight verbosity and some additional details beyond the scope of the question, but these do not detract from correctness or clarity.",2,67%,"The main elements capturing the APS (Alignment and Phasing System) behavior in the SysML model and the associated documentation focus on state machine diagrams and activity diagrams that represent the system’s dynamic and functional aspects.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Behavioral Representation via State Machines and Activity Diagrams**  
   According to the additional documentation context from the TMT-APS OCDD, the high-level behavior of APS-PEAS (Phasing and Edge Alignment System) is primarily captured using **state machine diagrams**. These state machines model the system’s various states and the transitions between them, providing a clear view of the system’s operational modes and lifecycle.

     This is a Block and Sequencer that includes children such as ""APS Mission Simulation"" (an Activity) and ""APS Mission Acquisition Logical"" (a Diagram Info element). The presence of an **Activity** (""APS Mission Simulation"" [_18_0_5_baa02e2_1453425599742_45734_174635]) indicates detailed behavioral modeling of mission-level operations. The ""APS Mission Acquisition Logical"" diagram shows interactions of state machines of various functions and components, directly linking to the state machine representation of behavior.

   - **APS Mission [ID: _17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1389728637481_651557_61606]**  
     This Block and Sequencer contains an **Activity** named ""APS Mission"" and properties representing interfaces and timing constraints (e.g., ""maxPhasingTime"" as a Value_property). The activity here models the mission-level behavior, while the sequencer aspect suggests orchestration of states or steps.

   - **APS User [ID: _17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1389730769202_855584_72742]**  
     This Block includes several **Activities** such as ""Trigger_FTA,"" ""Trigger_CTA,"" ""APS Actions,"" and ""Trigger_GetRBeam,"" which represent user interactions and triggers that drive APS behavior. These activities model detailed behavioral flows related to user commands and system responses.

   - **APS Operational Blackbox Specification JPL [ID: _18_0_5_baa02e2_1450823388863_993102_157919]**  
     This Block contains operations and properties related to specific APS functions, such as calculating optimal mirror segment motions and measuring tip/tilt. These operations represent functional behaviors that are part of the overall system behavior.

3. **Behavioral Hierarchy and Integration**  
   The **APS Mission Logical** block acts as a high-level behavioral container, integrating simulation activities and state machine interactions (via the ""APS Mission Acquisition Logical"" diagram). The **APS Mission** block further refines this with mission-specific activities and timing constraints. The **APS User** block models the external triggers and user-driven behaviors that influence the system.

4. **Significance of These Elements**  
   - The **state machine diagrams** (referenced in the ""APS Mission Acquisition Logical"" diagram) provide a formal way to capture the system’s states and transitions, essential for understanding system modes and verifying correct sequencing.  
   - The **activity diagrams** (e.g., ""APS Mission Simulation,"" ""APS Actions,"" and trigger activities) provide detailed workflows and procedural logic, enabling verification of timing and functional requirements.  
   - The **operations and properties** in the ""APS Operational Blackbox Specification JPL"" block represent concrete functional behaviors and constraints that the system must fulfill.

### Conclusion

The main elements capturing the APS behavior are:

- **State machine diagrams** representing the high-level states and transitions of APS-PEAS, particularly shown in the ""APS Mission Acquisition Logical"" diagram within the **APS Mission Logical** block [_18_0_5_baa02e2_1450822413111_196043_154490].  
- **Activity diagrams** detailing the execution steps of use cases and system actions, such as ""APS Mission Simulation"" activity [_18_0_5_baa02e2_1453425599742_45734_174635] and user-triggered activities in the **APS User** block [_17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1389730769202_855584_72742].  
- **Operations and properties** in the **APS Operational Blackbox Specification JPL** block [_18_0_5_baa02e2_1450823388863_993102_157919] that define specific functional behaviors and constraints.

Together, these elements provide a comprehensive behavioral model of APS, enabling verification of system functionality and timing requirements as described in the TMT-APS documentation."
M-TC-3,What requirements are verified by the model?,0.6188841570622823,60,"The assistant's response provides a detailed explanation of the types of requirements verified by the model, focusing on operational duration, optical performance, and calibration procedures. However, it does not explicitly mention several key requirements listed in the reference answer, such as alignment after post-segment exchange, calibration of M1CS Edge Sensors, maintenance alignment, off-axis wavefront error measurements, elevation dependence of M2 and M3, and segment warping harness influence functions. The response is clear and well-structured but lacks coverage of the specific keywords expected. Therefore, while the answer is informative and partially correct, it is incomplete with respect to the specific requirements verified by the model as per the reference.",1,17%,"The SysML model verifies a set of key requirements related to the TMT Adaptive Optics Platform System (APS) by simulating system behavior and analyzing operational scenarios to ensure conformity with specified performance and optical criteria.

Specifically, the model verifies the following types of requirements:

1. **Operational Duration Requirements:**  
   The model includes verification of critical operational scenarios such as:  
   - Post-Segment Exchange Duration  
   - Registration Duration  
   - Reference Point Tracking Duration  
   - Self Test Duration  
   
   These scenarios are designed to confirm that the APS system meets timing constraints for various operational phases, ensuring the system can perform necessary actions within required timeframes. This verification process is described in the APS Use Case Development documentation [ID: TMT-APS Use Case Development.pdf].

2. **Optical Performance Requirements:**  
   The model verifies optical requirements imported from DOORS, such as:  
   - The use of the primary mirror as the APS entrance pupil [REQ-2-APS-0011]  
   - Effective r0 values (Fried parameter) used in optical modeling to characterize atmospheric turbulence effects on image quality.  
   
   These requirements ensure that the APS optical design and performance meet the necessary criteria for the TMT Observatory System. The verification involves simulating optical behavior and confirming that the system adheres to these performance parameters [ID: TMT-APS Requirements Flow-down.pdf].

3. **Calibration and System Behavior Conformity:**  
   The model supports verification of calibration procedures and overall system behavior to ensure that the APS operates correctly within the broader TMT Observatory System. This includes confirming that calibration steps are performed within expected durations and that system responses align with the defined requirements [ID: TMT-APS Use Case Development.pdf].

**Summary:**  
The model acts as a comprehensive verification tool by formalizing requirements, defining an analysis context, and connecting system values to simulate and analyze APS behavior. It verifies requirements related to operational timing constraints, optical performance parameters, and calibration procedures, thereby ensuring that the APS meets its design and performance goals within the TMT Observatory System.

This integrated approach, combining imported requirements from DOORS and scenario-based verification, provides confidence that the APS system will perform as intended under operational conditions."
S-TC-1,Which activities are included in verification of the Post Segment Exchange?,0.7930729718037144,85,"The assistant's response is detailed and covers most of the activities mentioned in the reference answer, including Correcting Rigid Body and Segment Figures, M3 Alignment, Broadband Phasing, and Offloading Sensor Offsets. It also adds useful context about the sequence and time constraints. However, it omits 'Coarse Tilt Alignment' and 'Narrowband Phasing,' which are explicitly mentioned in the reference and expected keywords. The explanation is clear and well-structured, but missing these keywords reduces completeness and keyword coverage scores.",4,67%,"The verification of the Post Segment Exchange alignment in the TMT project involves a specific sequence of activities designed to ensure precise alignment and phasing of the telescope segments after they have been exchanged. According to the documentation and the relevant SysML model elements, the key activities included in this verification process are:

1. **Correcting Rigid Body and Segment Figure Correction**  
   This activity involves adjusting the rigid body positioning of the segments as well as correcting the segment figure (shape). Notably, there is a flag that allows the process to skip segment figure correction in certain cases, providing flexibility depending on the alignment needs. This step ensures that the segments are properly positioned and shaped before further alignment steps.

2. **M3 Alignment Procedure**  
   The M3 alignment is a critical step that aligns the tertiary mirror (M3) to support the overall optical path alignment. This procedure is part of the sequential activities and is essential for maintaining the optical quality and system performance.

3. **Broadband Phasing Activities**  
   These include two specific broadband phasing steps:  
   - **Broadband Phasing 1000**  
   - **Broadband Phasing 30**  
   These steps refine the phase alignment of the segments over a broad wavelength range, improving the coherence of the combined mirror surface and enabling high-quality imaging.

4. **Offload Sensor Offsets**  
   This activity involves offloading sensor offsets to maintain accurate sensor calibration and alignment data, ensuring that the system can continue to operate correctly after the segment exchange.

These activities are executed **sequentially** to capture and align the segments in tip/tilt and phase, and to initiate guiding on the same star used for the coarse tilt alignment. This sequence is critical to achieving the required alignment precision after segment exchange.

Additionally, the entire Post Segment Exchange alignment verification process has a **maximum time constraint of 7200 seconds (2 hours)** for on-axis alignment verification, emphasizing the need for efficiency in these activities.

**Summary:**  
The verification of the Post Segment Exchange alignment includes the following sequential activities:  
- Correcting Rigid Body and Segment Figure correction (with conditional skipping of segment figure correction)  
- M3 Alignment Procedure  
- Broadband Phasing 1000 and Broadband Phasing 30  
- Offload Sensor Offsets  

These steps ensure precise segment alignment in tip/tilt and phase, enabling the telescope to guide on the same star used for coarse tilt alignment, all within a 2-hour time limit [TMT-APS OCDD.pdf, pages 30, 32, 38, 56; TMT-APS Use Case Development.pdf, pages 2, 24].

If you have specific SysML model elements related to these activities, I can help map these steps directly to those elements for further clarity."

It also references relevant tasks and sequences, providing a comprehensive explanation. However, it does not explicitly mention LUT calibration, which is part of the reference answer. The response is clear and well-structured but somewhat verbose compared to the concise reference. Overall, it effectively addresses the question with high completeness and keyword coverage, missing only the explicit mention of LUT calibration.",2,29%,"Based on the analysis of the provided SysML model elements and the additional TMT project documentation context, here is a detailed and clear summary addressing **in what cases a new guide star is acquired**:

---

### Summary: When Is a New Guide Star Acquired?

A **new guide star acquisition** occurs whenever the current guide star cannot be used effectively for guiding the telescope and adaptive optics (AO) system. This need arises due to various operational, observational, or system constraints. The acquisition of a new guide star is a critical step in the TMT observation workflow to ensure accurate pointing, alignment, and AO loop closure.

---

### Key Cases Triggering New Guide Star Acquisition

1. **Failure to Acquire or Lock on the Current Guide Star**  
   - If the system attempts to acquire a guide star but fails to lock the AO loops (e.g., Tip/Tilt/Focus (TTF) or high order loops), it triggers acquisition of a new guide star.  
   - This is reflected in the workflow where the system may ""Acquire new star, don’t guide, don’t close PIT loop, select"" indicating the previous guide star is abandoned and a new one must be acquired ([Additional Context], TMT-APS Use Cases).  
   - For example, in the **NFIRAOS LGS MCAO Guide Star Acquisition Sequence** ([_hidden_MMS_1518132636961_4178f709-3909-43c8-a777-00c1c893c9a8_pei]), if the PWFS or OIWFS fails to lock, the system will attempt to acquire a backup or alternative guide star.

2. **Change of Target or Guide Star Field**  
   - When the science target changes or the guide star field changes (e.g., due to dithering, nodding, or non-sidereal tracking), a new guide star acquisition may be necessary.  
   - This is especially true if the new target requires different guide stars or if the current guide stars move out of the patrol field of view of the On Instrument Wavefront Sensors (OIWFS) or On Detector Guide Windows (ODGW).  
   - The **Switching** process ([_hidden_MMS_1518141769407_136f5d70-cea6-427e-823e-634c00abc69c_pei]) describes scenarios where guide stars fall off the patrol field or new stars enter, requiring the system to acquire and lock on new guide stars.

3. **Telescope Pointing and Alignment Limitations**  
   - Due to telescope pointing repeatability limitations and the limited field of view of guide star wavefront sensors, the initially selected guide star may not be properly acquired.  
   - In such cases, a separate acquisition step is required to find and lock on a new guide star to correct pointing and focus errors ([Additional Context], OAD_CCR41.pdf).  
   - This is detailed in **Task A1: Acquiring Telescope Pointing** ([_hidden_MMS_1526487007314_bf3bcca8-d57d-41f5-906a-2b8ca9fbb6b6_pei]) where the system may point to a bright star (J < 19) for pointing and focus correction before placing guide stars on OIWFS and PWFS.

4. **Initial Acquisition When NGS and Science Object Differ**  
   - When the Natural Guide Star (NGS) used for AO correction is not the same as the science target, additional acquisition steps are needed to ensure proper alignment and guiding.  
   - If the initial guide star acquisition fails or the NGS is different, the system proceeds to acquire and lock on a new guide star to close the AO loops ([Additional Context], TMT Observation Workflow.pdf).  
   - This is supported by the **Acquisition for NFIRAOS** description ([_hidden_MMS_1518138416249_4b96b87a-2163-42fc-82c7-1b453fa2d29d_pei]) which states that if the NGS and science object differ, additional checks and possibly new guide star acquisition are required.

5. **Pre-Imaging and Guide Star Determination for New or Unknown Fields**  
   - For new star fields without prior detailed observation or catalog information, pre-imaging may be required to identify suitable guide stars.  
   - Although this pre-imaging time is not counted in the 5-minute acquisition budget, it leads to the selection and acquisition of new guide stars for the observation ([_hidden_MMS_1518132506497_f8db2ce7-0d48-4706-809d-0771e5940695_pei]).  
   - The system chooses the AO mode and guide stars based on the pre-imaging results or catalog data.

6. **Backup Guide Star Acquisition Due to Catalog or Environmental Issues**  
   - If the initially selected guide star is found to be unsuitable (e.g., not a point source, wrong magnitude, or affected by weather conditions), the system will acquire a backup guide star.  
   - This is part of the acquisition process described in **Task A8: Acquire and Lock TT OIWFS/ODGW** ([_hidden_MMS_1526487226082_d000c5f1-f7b1-4d8d-b8eb-97f4cc8ba7d6_pei]) where failure to capture the guide star leads to fallback on backup stars.

  Describes initial acquisition of a bright star for pointing and focus correction when telescope blind pointing errors are large, leading to new guide star acquisition.

- **Task A5: Acquire and Lock TT or TTF and HO PWFS** ([_hidden_MMS_1526487083716_dccab1ac-8dbd-4f64-84e8-c3c13a1d0888_pei])  
  Details the process of acquiring the Pyramid Wavefront Sensor guide star, including spiral search and aborting acquisition if unsuccessful, which triggers new star acquisition.

- **Switching** ([_hidden_MMS_1518141769407_136f5d70-cea6-427e-823e-634c00abc69c_pei])  
  Explains the need to switch guide stars during dithering or non-sidereal tracking when stars move out of sensor fields, requiring new guide star acquisition.

- **Acquisition to Determine Guide Stars and AO Mode** ([_hidden_MMS_1518132506497_f8db2ce7-0d48-4706-809d-0771e5940695_pei])  
  Describes pre-imaging and guide star selection for unknown fields, leading to acquisition of new guide stars.

- **WFOS baseline acquisition scenario** ([_hidden_MMS_1518138801190_6ea704d3-d94a-4b14-a4f9-fd2cfa5ce599_pei])  
  Shows acquisition steps for WFOS instrument, including checking guide star visibility and performing blind offsets if guide stars are not found, effectively acquiring new guide stars.

---

### Additional Notes

- The **Guide Star Acquisition Sequence** is a complex, multi-step process involving coordination between the Telescope Control System (TCS), Adaptive Optics Sequencer (AOSQ), and Instrument Sequencers (e.g., IRIS, IRMS, WFOS).  
- The acquisition process includes fallback and backup strategies to ensure guide stars are acquired within the required time budgets ([_hidden_MMS_1526247006940_099f3964-dc32-4c8c-a2fa-320dfb066740_pei]).  
- The system relies on pre-planned guide star catalogs and observation preparation tools, but also accommodates targets of opportunity or fields with poor prior knowledge, which may require additional acquisition steps ([_hidden_MMS_1517516636980_e86adadf-a693-4bec-913e-81071bcc941f_pei]).

---

### **In Conclusion:**

A **new guide star is acquired** in the following main cases:

- When the current guide star cannot be acquired or locked due to acquisition failure or poor signal.  
- When the science target or guide star field changes, requiring new guide stars for AO correction.  
- When telescope pointing or alignment errors prevent using the current guide star, necessitating acquisition of a different star for correction.  
- When the NGS and science object differ, requiring additional acquisition steps to ensure proper guiding.  
- When observing new or poorly characterized fields, pre-imaging leads to selection and acquisition of new guide stars.  
- When backup guide stars are needed due to catalog errors, environmental conditions, or guide star unsuitability.

These cases are well documented and modeled in the TMT SysML elements such as **Task A1 to A9** sequences ([_hidden_MMS_1526487007314_bf3bcca8-d57d-41f5-906a-2b8ca9fbb6b6_pei], [_hidden_MMS_1526487083716_dccab1ac-8dbd-4f64-84e8-c3c13a1d0888_pei], [_hidden_MMS_1518132506497_f8db2ce7-0d48-4706-809d-0771e5940695_pei]) and supported by the additional context from the TMT Observation Workflow and APS Use Cases documents.

S-TC-3,What’s the maximum misalignment of M1 when offloading sensor offsets?,0.5886420749925059,60,"The assistant's response provides a detailed explanation of the maximum misalignment of M1 segments during sensor offset offloading, specifying a piston misalignment limit of ±110 nm, which is much stricter than the 1 µm stated in the reference. While the response is thorough and clear, it contradicts the reference answer's value of 1 µm, which is the key expected keyword. The assistant also elaborates on the significance and context of this limit, which adds completeness but does not align with the reference's stated maximum misalignment. Therefore, the response is correct in context but does not match the reference answer's key numeric value, leading to a moderate score.",3,75%,"The maximum misalignment of the M1 segments when offloading sensor offsets is specified as piston within ±110 nm (surface). This requirement is explicitly stated in the additional context from the documentation referencing requirement [REQ-1-OAD-2262] [ID: 11156]. This limit ensures that the M1CS (M1 Control System) sensors remain within their most linear operating range during the offload process, which is critical for maintaining precise segment alignment in piston, tip, and tilt.

1. **Alignment Procedures [_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371471_401310_94570]**  
   This class describes the overall APS (Active Phasing System) alignment procedures, including the steps of acquiring stars, configuring cameras, taking reference and Shack-Hartmann images, calculating misalignments, and issuing corrections to the control systems (M1CS, M2CS, M3CS). The alignment procedures rely on accurate sensor data and precise control of segment positions, including piston offsets. The ±110 nm piston misalignment limit directly impacts these procedures by defining the acceptable range for segment adjustments to keep the system within linear sensor response.

2. **Procedure Executive and Analysis Software [_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371685_335757_94772]**  
   The APS_PEAS software framework executes the alignment procedures and analysis computations that correct misalignments of M1, M2, and M3. The software interfaces with the M1CS among other telescope control systems to apply corrections. The piston misalignment limit of ±110 nm is a key operational constraint that APS_PEAS must respect when offloading sensor offsets to M1 segments to ensure sensor linearity and effective alignment.

3. **Keck Misalignment Uncertainties [_17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1386568977159_466065_62067]**  
   This diagram and related documentation provide context on misalignment uncertainties observed at Keck Observatory, which have been studied and modeled to predict TMT performance. The atmospheric turbulence limits and scaling models inform the expected uncertainties in segment alignment. The ±110 nm piston limit fits within this broader understanding of alignment precision and sensor linearity, ensuring that offloads do not exceed the range where sensor readings become unreliable.

4. **Entrance Requirements and Conditions [_18_0_2_b4c02e1_1439147837414_716095_148507]**  
   This element outlines the nominal operating conditions required before alignment procedures begin, ensuring that all subsystems, including M1CS sensors, operate within calibrated and expected parameters. Maintaining piston misalignment within ±110 nm supports these entrance conditions by preventing sensor saturation or nonlinear behavior during offload.

### Significance of the ±110 nm Piston Limit:

- **Sensor Linearity:** Keeping piston misalignment within ±110 nm ensures that M1CS sensors operate in their linear range, which is essential for accurate measurement and control of segment positions.
- **Alignment Accuracy:** This limit supports the overall APS alignment procedures by bounding the maximum correction applied during offload, preventing excessive actuator commands that could degrade alignment or cause instability.
- **Operational Safety and Performance:** By adhering to this limit, the system maintains stable and precise segment phasing, which is critical for the telescope’s optical performance.

### Summary:

The maximum misalignment of M1 segments during offloading of sensor offsets is piston within ±110 nm (surface) [REQ-1-OAD-2262] [ID: 11156]. This requirement is fundamental to the APS alignment procedures [_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371471_401310_94570] and the APS_PEAS software [_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371685_335757_94772], ensuring that the M1CS sensors remain in their most linear and effective operating range. This limit is consistent with the atmospheric and sensor uncertainty models derived from Keck Observatory data [_17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1386568977159_466065_62067] and supports the nominal entrance conditions for alignment [_18_0_2_b4c02e1_1439147837414_716095_148507]. Maintaining this piston misalignment bound is critical for precise segment alignment, stable control, and optimal telescope performance."

The response focuses more on port types and general interface categories rather than the exact interface names requested. Therefore, while the answer is informative and clear, it lacks completeness and keyword coverage regarding the specific interfaces asked for.",0,0%,"The interfaces of the APS (Adaptive Optics System) blackbox specification are defined as SysML ports that connect the Logical and Physical architectural elements of the system. These interfaces are critical because they enable communication and data exchange between different components within the APS, supporting its operational domain and mission functions.

According to the APS Detailed Design Document (DDD) [ID: TMT-APS DDD, pages 209-211] and the TMT-APS Use Cases [ID: TMT-APS Use Cases, page 15], the APS blackbox includes the following types and quantities of interfaces:

For example, the interface labeled **PEAS2M1CSOut** is one such connection that illustrates how data flows from one subsystem to another within the APS architecture.

The significance of these interfaces lies in their role in enabling the APS to perform its functions effectively. For instance:

- **Analog and Digital ports** handle sensor data and control signals essential for system monitoring and actuation.
- **Ethernet and USB ports** provide communication pathways for data transfer and external device connectivity.
- **Motor Control ports** are crucial for driving mechanical components within the APS.
- **Pressure ports (P_in, P_inout, P_out)** manage pneumatic or hydraulic inputs and outputs necessary for system operation.

In summary, the APS blackbox specification defines a comprehensive set of interfaces as SysML ports that facilitate the integration and interaction of the system’s logical and physical elements. These interfaces are explicitly enumerated in the APS DDD and are visually represented in the SysML BDD, ensuring traceability and clarity in the system design."

These requirements define the essential functions, performance, interfaces, and operational conditions that the APS must satisfy to fulfill its role in the TMT observatory.

### Summary of Verified APS Requirements

1. **Functional Role of APS**  
   The APS is responsible for the rigid body alignment of the primary (M1), secondary (M2), and tertiary (M3) mirrors. It uses starlight to measure wavefront errors and compute corrections to align the optics precisely. This core function is documented in the TMT requirements [REQ-1-OAD-0170, ID=826].  
   - This functional requirement is foundational and likely represented in the model under the general APS requirements pattern, such as the **APS Requirements Pattern** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1401220741337_179093_88901].

   The APS Acquisition Camera must support:  
   - A full image update rate faster than 0.2 Hz.  
   - A 10 Hz update rate for regions of interest up to 2 arcseconds.  
   This ensures timely and precise wavefront sensing for alignment corrections [REQ-2-APS-0127].  
   - This performance requirement would be part of detailed APS requirements, possibly under the **APS GUI with engineering data** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1382411778495_652975_58093], which implies interface and data handling capabilities.

3. **Maintenance Capability**  
   APS must allow service and maintenance operations while installed on the Nasmyth Platform, accessible from defined access positions [REQ-2-APS-0073].  
   - This operational requirement ensures maintainability without system removal, critical for observatory uptime. It would be captured in the model as part of APS operational or interface requirements.

4. **Mechanical and Electrical Environmental Requirements**  
   The APS mechanical and electrical systems must meet environmental requirements to ensure reliable operation on the Nasmyth platform [REQ-2-APS-0070].  
   - This includes robustness to temperature, vibration, and other environmental factors.  
   - Such requirements are likely included in the **APS contribution to Sys. Demand Load inside the Summit Facilities Building** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1380822328755_71197_47231], which addresses system demand and environmental constraints.

5. **Interfaces and Structural Requirements**  
   APS shall have structural and mechanical interfaces compliant with the TMT Telescope Control System (TCS) and mirror control systems, ensuring integration and operational functionality [REQ-2-APS-0173].  
   - This ensures APS fits physically and functionally within the telescope system architecture.  
   - These interface requirements are reflected in the model elements owned by the ""03b OLD: proposed requirements"" group, such as the **APS GUI with engineering data** and **APS contribution to Sys. Demand Load** classes.

6. **Verification Role**  
   APS acts as the “bottom line” wavefront sensor for the TMT optics, providing critical data for alignment verification during Assembly, Integration, and Verification (AIV) phases [TMT-APS DDD].  
   - This role emphasizes APS’s importance in system-level verification and validation.  
   - The **APS Requirements Pattern** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1401220741337_179093_88901] likely encapsulates this verification focus as part of the requirement sequencing and traceability.

### Relationship Between Model Elements and Documentation

- The **APS Requirements Pattern** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1401220741337_179093_88901] serves as a template or pattern for defining APS requirements, ensuring consistency and completeness when creating new requirements. It is foundational for structuring the APS requirements in the SysML model.

- The **APS Template Requirement (copy and past when making new requirement)** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1380058130353_130451_59342] is a reusable template to facilitate the creation of new APS requirements, ensuring they follow a standard format.

- The **APS GUI with engineering data** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1382411778495_652975_58093] and **APS contribution to Sys. Demand Load inside the Summit Facilities Building** [_17_0_2_3_b4c02e1_1380822328755_71197_47231] represent specific requirements related to system interfaces, data handling, and environmental/system demand constraints.

- The ownership of these elements under groups like ""03b OLD: proposed requirements"" and ""09 APS Requirement Templates"" indicates their role in the requirements lifecycle, from proposal to templating and finalization.

### Summary of APS from the Model Elements and Documentation

1. **Definition and Role:**
   - The APS is described as a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor system that manages the overall pre-adaptive-optics wavefront quality of the TMT. It adjusts critical parameters such as:
     - Segment pistons and tip/tilts of the primary mirror segments (M1)
     - Segment surface figure via warping harness adjustments
     - Two degrees of rigid body motion of the tertiary mirror (M3)
     - Piston and tip/tilt or x/y translation of the secondary mirror (M2)
   
   This is detailed in the documentation of the model element named **""The APS and Its Role in TMT""** [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371296_417022_94439]. The documentation clarifies that APS’s purpose is to align the telescope rather than verify individual optic surface requirements.

2. **Design Basis and Algorithms:**
   - The APS design and concept are based on the Phasing Camera System (PCS) used at the Keck Observatory, leveraging similar algorithms that have been proven successful. The APS generates solutions that translate into desired sensor readings for M1 or actuator settings for M2 and M3.
   - These solutions can be analyzed against environmental factors like elevation and temperature to create look-up tables for corrections, although creating these tables is outside the APS’s direct responsibility.

3. **System Components and Control:**
   - From the additional project documentation context, APS includes both hardware and software components.
   - The **APS Instrument Control System (APS-ICS)** acts as the single point of control for all APS optical bench components.
   - The **APS Procedure Executive and Analysis Software (APS-PEAS)** provides the interface for executing alignment and phasing procedures and performing analysis computations.
   - The system operation is overseen by an optical scientist who plans and specifies procedures during observations.

4. **Significance in TMT:**
   - APS is critical for maintaining the telescope’s optical performance by ensuring that the primary mirror segments and secondary and tertiary mirrors are correctly aligned and phased.
   - This alignment is essential before adaptive optics corrections are applied, making APS a foundational subsystem for the telescope’s imaging quality.

### Concrete Example from the Model

- It contains an instance specification referencing the APS concept and its applied stereotype, linking the abstract description to the system architecture.
- The owner element **""Executive Summary""** [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371533_928329_94617] situates this APS description within a broader project overview, indicating its importance at the system level.

### In Conclusion

The APS is a sophisticated wavefront sensing and control system integral to the Thirty Meter Telescope’s ability to produce high-quality images. It achieves this by precisely aligning and phasing the primary mirror segments and secondary and tertiary mirrors using advanced algorithms and coordinated hardware/software control. The model element [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371296_417022_94439] and its documentation provide a detailed conceptual overview, while the additional project documentation expands on the system’s operational and control aspects.

It also provides extensive context about the APS system, procedures, and verification methods, enhancing clarity and completeness. However, it does not explicitly mention ""Parametric Analysis"" or the exact term ""APS_PEAS"" in a way that directly ties to parametric analysis, which is part of the expected keywords. The response is somewhat lengthy but comprehensive, and the core purpose matches the reference. Overall, the response is correct, complete, and clear, with good keyword coverage except for parametric analysis.",3,60%,"The main purpose of the provided SysML model and its associated documentation is to **verify and ensure the performance requirements of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) Alignment and Phasing System (APS)**, particularly focusing on telescope alignment accuracy, timing, electrical power, and pointing errors. This is achieved by modeling the behavior of the APS through detailed procedural and activity specifications, enabling automated analysis and validation of system performance.

### Key Points and Relationships in the Model:

1. **Verification of Telescope Alignment and Performance Requirements**  
   The model captures high-level procedures and activities that the APS uses to perform telescope alignments and calibrations. These procedures verify requirements such as timing constraints, electrical power usage, and pointing accuracy. This is explicitly stated in the additional context from the documentation:  
   > ""The main purpose of the model in the context of the TMT project is to verify requirements on the performance of the telescope, including aspects such as timing, electrical power, and pointing errors.""  
   This is done by extending the behavior of the **Procedure Executive and Analysis Software (PEAS)** through state machines and activities, specifying a context for automated analysis [TMT-APS Use Case Development.pdf].

2. **Modeling of High-Level Activities and Procedures**  
   The model includes detailed classes representing key APS activities, such as:  
   - **Coarse Tilt Alignment** [e.g., `_18_0_2_b4c02e1_1435176833274_329020_181737` and `_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371388_822146_94502`]  
     These classes describe the procedure to capture and correct segment tip/tilt errors after segment installation or exchange, ensuring segments are aligned within required tolerances (e.g., ±20 arcseconds maximum tip/tilt error on the sky, reduced to ±3 arcseconds after coarse alignment). The documentation details the procedure steps, parameters, and expected outcomes, such as the use of the SH-0 mask and the capture range of ±30 arcseconds on-sky.  
   - **Measure Warping Harness Influence Function** [`_18_0_5_c0402fd_1471454552643_583973_177103`]  
     This activity collects on-sky data to measure the influence functions of the warping harnesses on the mirror segments, critical for segment figure correction.  
   - **Self Test Activities** (e.g., ""Self Test"" `_18_0_5_c0402fd_1474660580735_84580_188513`)  
     These verify the proper operation of APS hardware and software components, such as the Acquisition Pointing and Tracking (APT) and Pupil Image Tracking (PIT) systems.

3. **Use of Procedural and Sequencer Elements**  
   The model uses **Sequencer** and **View** stereotypes to represent workflows and procedures, such as the coarse tilt alignment sequencer. This approach allows the system to:  
   - Separate procedure flow from step implementation (see ""Benefits of a Process Engine Approach"" [MMS_1456193324343_0a5b9572-99cd-47bf-88ce-55df1ed054e4])  
   - Enable parallel processing and reuse of procedure steps  
   - Facilitate automated data archiving and analysis after each step

4. **Integration with External Subsystems and Communication**  
   The APS_PEAS communication design [MMS_1456193104306_1b7064ef-0467-458a-a3b8-873a0a6a37d1] shows how APS interacts with telescope control subsystems (M1CS, M2CS, M3CS, TCS) via the Common Software (CSW) framework, ensuring coordinated control and status monitoring during alignment procedures.

5. **Verification and Diagnostics**  
   The model includes views and classes dedicated to verification and diagnostics, such as:  
   - **Verification** [MMS_1460327165642_6504dd30-8498-44b6-be66-2e957682db87], which outlines how APS verifies alignment procedures by checking convergence and consistency of measurements.  
   - **Diagnosing Procedure Anomalies** [MMS_1456188414478_7936724d-2860-44d5-ad98-d0b1bd1bc735], which provides user interface elements and data visualization tools to analyze procedure execution and identify anomalies.

6. **Supporting Documentation and Use Case Structure**  
   The model is structured to support document generation and traceability, with views such as ""Purpose of Use Case"" and ""Background"" providing context and rationale for the procedures. For example, the ""Background"" class [_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996370250_994157_93698] explains the heritage of APS from the Keck Phasing Camera System (PCS) and highlights differences and improvements.

7. **Concrete Example: Coarse Tilt Alignment**  
   The **Coarse Tilt Alignment** procedure is a concrete example illustrating the model’s purpose:  
   - It ensures that after segment installation or exchange, the tip/tilt errors are within ±20 arcseconds (maximum, not RMS) on the sky.  
   - Uses a single subaperture mask (SH-0) to avoid subimage confusion.  
   - Employs a raster search pattern with 9 images to extend the capture range to ±30 arcseconds.  
   - Achieves correction to within 0.3 arcseconds RMS, preparing for finer alignment steps.  
   This procedure is modeled as a sequencer with detailed documentation and parameters, enabling simulation and verification of timing and performance requirements [IDs: `_18_0_2_b4c02e1_1435176833274_329020_181737`, `_18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371388_822146_94502`].

### Summary

The **main purpose of the model** is to provide a comprehensive, executable representation of the APS alignment and phasing procedures and their interactions with telescope subsystems, enabling:  
- **Verification of telescope alignment performance requirements** (e.g., tip/tilt accuracy, timing constraints)  
- **Automated analysis and validation** of procedure execution and outcomes  
- **Support for diagnostics and anomaly detection** through detailed data visualization and execution history  
- **Clear separation of procedure flow and implementation**, facilitating maintainability and reuse  
- **Traceability and documentation** to support development, integration, and operations

This modeling approach ensures that the APS can reliably perform its critical role in maintaining the TMT’s optical performance, with confidence that all requirements are met and verified before and during telescope operations.

These requirements encompass system behavior, operational scenarios, timing and duration constraints, and optical performance parameters, ensuring the system meets the stringent specifications outlined in the TMT project documentation.

### Key Verified Requirements:

1. **System Behavior and Operational Scenarios**  
   The model captures and verifies APS requirements that define how the system should behave under various operational conditions. For example, it includes scenarios where the primary mirror is used as the APS entrance pupil, ensuring that the optical path and system alignment conform to expected performance standards [TMT-APS Requirements Flow-down.pdf, chunk_id: 25df312c08a9, page 61]. This ensures that the APS operates correctly within the broader observatory system context.

2. **Timing and Duration Constraints**  
   The model incorporates analyses such as Duration Analyses and Automatic Duration Analysis to verify timing-related requirements. These analyses assess whether system activities, including calibrations, alignments, and maintenance tasks, can be completed within specified time frames. This is critical for maintaining system availability and performance during observation windows [TMT-APS Use Case Development.pdf, chunk_id: 25df312c08a9, pages 13, 21, 24].

3. **Calibration, Alignment, and Maintenance Activities**  
   The model verifies requirements related to the execution and timing of calibration and alignment procedures, which are essential for maintaining optical performance and system accuracy. By modeling these activities and their durations, the system ensures that maintenance operations do not adversely impact overall system readiness or performance [TMT-APS Use Case Development.pdf, chunk_id: 25df312c08a9, pages 13, 21, 24].

4. **Optical Performance Parameters**  
   The model verifies requirements related to optical parameters, such as the use of the primary mirror as the APS entrance pupil, ensuring that the optical design and alignment meet the necessary performance criteria. This verification supports the system’s ability to deliver the required image quality and adaptive optics correction [TMT-APS Requirements Flow-down.pdf, chunk_id: 25df312c08a9, page 61].

- **Connection of System Value to Requirements:** The model links system performance metrics and behaviors directly to requirements, providing traceability and evidence of compliance.

### Summary

In essence, the SysML model verifies requirements that ensure the APS and the broader TMT Observatory System operate correctly, efficiently, and within specified performance bounds. It covers behavioral requirements, timing and duration constraints for critical activities, and optical performance parameters, all grounded in formalized requirements and supported by detailed analyses. This integrated verification approach ensures that the system meets the TMT Observatory’s stringent specifications and operational needs."
S-TC-1,Which activities are included in verification of the Post Segment Exchange?,0.80962834314829,75,"The response provides a detailed and clear explanation of the verification activities, including Coarse Tilt Alignment, Broadband Phasing, Rigid Body and Segment Figure Correction, and additional steps like off-axis wavefront measurements and maintenance alignment. However, it misses mentioning 'Offloading Sensor Offsets' and 'M3 Alignment' explicitly, which are part of the expected keywords. Also, Narrowband Phasing is not mentioned. The answer is comprehensive and clear but incomplete regarding all expected activities.",2,33%,"The verification of the Post Segment Exchange Alignment use case in the TMT project involves a series of specific activities designed to ensure that the newly installed segments of the primary mirror are properly aligned and phased. These activities are part of the Alignment and Phasing System (APS) procedures and are critical for maintaining the optical performance of the telescope after segment exchange.

Based on the provided documentation and model context, the key activities included in the verification of the Post Segment Exchange are:

1. **Initializing the Post Segment Exchange Alignment System (InitializePEAS)**  
   This is the first step where the alignment system is prepared and initialized to begin the verification process. It sets up the necessary system state and parameters for subsequent alignment activities.

2. **Correcting Rigid Body and Segment Figure**  
   This activity involves adjusting the position and shape of the mirror segments. Notably, there is a flag that can be set to skip the correction of the segment figure in some steps, indicating flexibility in the procedure depending on the verification phase or conditions.

3. **Coarse Tilt Alignment**  
   This step captures and aligns the segments in tip and tilt, which are angular adjustments necessary to roughly position the segments correctly relative to each other.

4. **Broadband Phasing 1000 Activity**  
   This includes starting telescope guiding on the same star used for the coarse tilt alignment. It refines the alignment by phasing the segments using broadband light, improving the optical coherence across the mirror surface.

5. **Off-axis Wavefront Measurements**  
   These measurements assess the wavefront quality off the optical axis, providing data to further refine segment alignment and phasing.

6. **Maintenance Alignment Steps**  
   These are additional alignment procedures performed to maintain the alignment quality over time, ensuring long-term stability after the initial post-exchange verification.

Together, these activities form a comprehensive verification process that ensures the new segments are correctly positioned and phased, maintaining the telescope’s optical performance after segment exchange. Each activity corresponds to a procedural step within the APS, as detailed in the TMT-APS Use Case Development, OCDD, and DDD documents.

In summary, the verification of the Post Segment Exchange includes initializing the alignment system, correcting segment positions and shapes, performing coarse tilt alignment, conducting broadband phasing with telescope guiding, taking off-axis wavefront measurements, and executing maintenance alignment steps. These activities collectively validate and maintain the precise alignment of the primary mirror segments after they have been exchanged."

All expected keywords are addressed explicitly or implicitly. Minor deduction is due to the response's complexity which might overwhelm some readers, but it does not detract from correctness or completeness.",3,43%,"The acquisition of a new guide star in the TMT adaptive optics (AO) system occurs in specific operational scenarios designed to ensure accurate and reliable AO correction. Based on the SysML model elements and the additional documentation context, the following detailed summary explains **when and why a new guide star is acquired**:

---

### 1. **Initial Acquisition and Setup Phase**

- During the **Setup APS, Acquire and Start Guiding** activity [\_17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1386574999910_876392_76809], the system configures the APS (Active Phasing System) and, if the input parameter `doAcquisition` is true, the APS operator selects a star to acquire. This star is then passed to the execution software to perform acquisition and/or start guiding.  
- The target coordinates can be provided as a star name (from a guide star catalog) or as RA/DEC coordinates.  
- This initial acquisition is fundamental when starting observations on a new target or field.

---

### 2. **Pre-Imaging for New or Uncatalogued Fields**

- When observing **new star fields without existing detailed observations or guide star catalogs**, pre-imaging is required to identify suitable guide stars and determine the preferred AO mode [“Pre-imaging to Determine Guide Stars and AO Mode” \_hidden_MMS_1518132506497_f8db2ce7-0d48-4706-809d-0771e5940695_pei].  
- This pre-imaging step is necessary to populate Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for AO calibration and to ensure optimal AO performance.  
- The baseline assumption is that guide star catalogs exist, so pre-imaging is an exception and not counted in the overall acquisition time budget.

---

### 3. **Operational Scenarios Requiring New Guide Star Acquisition**

- **Nodding/Dithering:**  
  - In LGS MCAO mode, after nodding or dithering the telescope, a new set of guide stars (OIWFS/ODGW/PWFS) must be acquired if tip/tilt/focus (T/T/F) correction is needed at the new position [“Nodding/Dithering” \_hidden_MMS_1518141722293_3827edab-c901-491f-9c2e-51bf7d493cea_pei].  
  - In NGSAO mode, a different natural guide star (NGS) and associated guide stars are acquired at the end of nodding if AO correction is required.

- **Guide Star Switching:**  
  - When a guide star moves out of the patrol field of view of its On-Instrument Wavefront Sensor (OIWFS) or On-Detector Guide Window (ODGW), or when fast-moving non-sidereal tracking requires it, the system switches to a new guide star [“Switching” \_hidden_MMS_1518141769407_136f5d70-cea6-427e-823e-634c00abc69c_pei].  
  - This involves stopping science exposure, switching the guide star, and restarting exposure after the switch is complete.  
  - The switch process includes instructing the Real-Time Controller (RTC) to ignore measurements from the old guide star and include measurements from the new one.

- **Backup Guide Star Acquisition:**  
  - During acquisition sequences (e.g., acquiring tip/tilt wavefront sensors or PWFS), if the initially selected guide star is not captured (no flux detected), the system steps back to a full window readout mode and, if still unsuccessful, restarts acquisition with a backup guide star [“Acquisition to Determine Guide Stars P6” \_hidden_MMS_1518134444442_e075ebdc-801a-4040-be28-94abb93451e4_pei].

---

### 4. **Calibration and Verification Phases**

- **Night-time Calibration:**  
  - The system acquires natural guide stars repeatedly at different zenith angles to populate LUTs for AO performance calibration [Additional context].  
  - This involves acquiring new guide stars as part of calibration sequences to characterize system performance.

- **Science Object Verification:**  
  - After acquisition and loop closure, the system verifies the science object alignment. If the science object is faint or different from the guide star, additional acquisition or alignment steps may be needed [“Acquisition for NFIRAOS” \_hidden_MMS_1518138416249_4b96b87a-2163-42fc-82c7-1b453fa2d29d_pei].

### 6. **Additional Notes**

- The acquisition process may be single-step or multi-step depending on the WFS field of view and telescope pointing repeatability [Additional context].  
- Some parameters and detailed timing remain TBD (To Be Determined) as the system design and operational procedures mature.  
- The Real-Time Controller (RTC) supports switching gradient computation algorithms during acquisition and lock sequences to optimize performance [Additional context].

### **Conclusion**

A **new guide star is acquired** in the TMT AO system primarily when:

- Starting observations on a new target or field (initial acquisition).  
- Observing new or uncatalogued star fields requiring pre-imaging.  
- After telescope nodding or dithering that changes the field requiring new guide stars.  
- When the current guide star moves out of the sensor’s patrol field or during fast-moving target tracking necessitating guide star switching.  
- When the initially selected guide star cannot be acquired, and a backup star is needed.  
- During calibration sequences to populate AO performance LUTs.  
- When verifying science object alignment requires additional acquisition steps.

These scenarios are supported and described in the SysML model elements such as **Setup APS, Acquire and Start Guiding** [\_17_0_2_3_41e01aa_1386574999910_876392_76809], **Pre-imaging to Determine Guide Stars and AO Mode** [\_hidden_MMS_1518132506497_f8db2ce7-0d48-4706-809d-0771e5940695_pei], **Switching** [\_hidden_MMS_1518141769407_136f5d70-cea6-427e-823e-634c00abc69c_pei], and **Nodding/Dithering** [\_hidden_MMS_1518141722293_3827edab-c901-491f-9c2e-51bf7d493cea_pei], as well as the detailed acquisition procedures in **Acquisition to Determine Guide Stars P6** [\_hidden_MMS_1518134444442_e075ebdc-801a-4040-be28-94abb93451e4_pei].

S-TC-3,What’s the maximum misalignment of M1 when offloading sensor offsets?,0.6411920380314031,60,"The assistant's response provides a detailed explanation of the maximum misalignment of M1 segments when offloading sensor offsets, specifying a piston tolerance of ±110 nm, which is significantly tighter than the reference answer's 1 µm. While the response is thorough and clear, it contradicts the reference value, which directly states the maximum allowed misalignment as 1 µm. The assistant's answer does not mention the 1 µm figure at all, instead focusing on a different tolerance value. The keywords 'M1' and 'sensor offsets' are covered well, but the critical keyword '1 µm' is missing, leading to a mismatch with the reference. The response is complete and clear but does not align with the reference's key numeric value, which is essential for correctness in this context.",3,75%,"The maximum misalignment of the primary mirror (M1) segments when offloading sensor offsets is governed by the piston tolerance requirement specified for M1 segments, which is ±110 nm. This limit ensures that the optical performance of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is maintained within stringent specifications.

### Explanation and Context

1. **Alignment and Offloading Process:**

   The Alignment and Phasing System (APS) measures wavefront errors and computes commands to adjust the M1 segments in piston, tip, and tilt, as well as other optics (M2 and M3). This process includes iterative corrections of rigid body motions and segment surface figure adjustments, typically repeated twice for refinement [TMT-APS OCDD.pdf, pages 31, 56; TMT-APS DDD.pdf, pages 44, 91].

   During this process, sensor offsets—small biases or drifts in the sensor readings—are detected. These offsets are offloaded to the M1 Control System (M1CS), which updates the segment actuator commands accordingly. This offloading effectively resets the sensor zero points, preventing the accumulation of drift over time and maintaining alignment accuracy.

2. **Maximum Misalignment Limit:**

   The M1CS must maintain segment piston errors within ±110 nm to meet the optical performance requirements [REQ-1-OAD-2262]. This is the maximum allowable misalignment in piston when offloading sensor offsets.

   The APS alignment procedures achieve a surface piston error of about 30 nm RMS after iterative broadband phasing steps, which is well within the ±110 nm tolerance, ensuring high-quality wavefront correction [TMT-APS DDD.pdf, page 56].

3. **Significance of Model Elements:**

   - The **""Alignment Procedures""** class [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371471_401310_94570] describes the detailed steps and methodology for aligning the optics, including the acquisition of stars, image analysis, and issuing corrections to the control systems. This class underpins the practical implementation of the alignment and offloading process.

   - The **""Procedure Executive and Analysis Software"" (APS_PEAS)** [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371685_335757_94772] provides the software framework that executes these alignment procedures and performs the analysis computations. APS_PEAS interfaces with the M1CS and other telescope control systems to implement the corrections and offloading commands.

4. **Additional Requirements and Performance:**

   - The APS can tilt uncontrolled segments by at least 40 arcseconds on the sky [REQ-1-OAD-2110], supporting precise alignment beyond piston adjustments.

   - The entire alignment and offloading process is designed to be efficient, with on-axis alignment achievable in less than 30 minutes [REQ-1-OAD-2325].

### Summary

- **Maximum piston misalignment of M1 segments when offloading sensor offsets:** ±110 nm [REQ-1-OAD-2262].
- **APS alignment procedures** [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371471_401310_94570] measure wavefront errors and compute corrections.
- **APS_PEAS software** [ID: _18_0_2_baa02e2_1422996371685_335757_94772] executes these procedures and commands M1CS.
- Offloading sensor offsets resets actuator zero points, preventing drift and maintaining piston errors within ±110 nm.
- Typical achieved piston error after alignment is ~30 nm RMS, well within tolerance.

This ensures that the primary mirror segments remain precisely phased, supporting the TMT’s stringent optical performance requirements."

However, it misses some specific states mentioned in the expected keywords and reference answer, such as Initialize Model State for M1CS Sensor Calibration, M2 and M3 Gravity Calibration, Pre-Session Calibration, Pupil Registration, Template State, Tracking Reference Point, and Wavefront Calibration. The response is clear and well-structured but could be improved by including all expected states explicitly to fully match the reference and keywords.",7,41%,"The PEAS (Procedure Executive and Analysis Software) states represent the major operational scenarios or use cases within the APS (Alignment and Phasing System) alignment and phasing activities for the TMT project.

From the provided documentation and model elements, the key points and their relationships are as follows:

1. **Model Element ""PEAS state"" [ID: _18_0_5_baa02e2_1461990581099_572979_175128]**  
   - This element is a SysML Class named ""PEAS state"" that conceptually represents the states of the PEAS software.  
   - It contains an InstanceSpecification child [ID: _18_0_5_baa02e2_1461990581099_572979_175128_asi] which likely enumerates or instantiates specific states or configurations of PEAS.  
   - Although the model element itself does not have explicit documentation or visible attributes listing the states, it is linked to applied stereotypes and slots that may define or constrain these states internally.

2. **Documentation Context**  
   - According to the TMT-APS Use Case Development documentation, the PEAS states correspond to major use cases in APS alignment and phasing.  
   - The documented PEAS states include:

     - Warping  
     - Harness Influence Function Analysis  
   - These states represent the operational modes or scenarios that PEAS transitions through during its function.

3. **Behavioral Note on State Transitions**  
   - PEAS is designed to leave a primary use case state only upon receiving an Abort signal (either internal or external).  
   - After an Abort, PEAS returns to the StandBy state, which acts as a safe or idle state.  
   - This behavior is critical for system safety and operational control, ensuring that PEAS can be reset or halted cleanly.

4. **Significance of the Model and Documentation Link**  
   - The ""PEAS state"" class [ID: _18_0_5_baa02e2_1461990581099_572979_175128] in the SysML model serves as the structural representation of these operational states.  
   - The documentation provides the semantic meaning and operational context of these states, explaining their role in the APS alignment and phasing process.  
   - Together, the model and documentation define both the formal structure (states as model elements) and the intended use and transitions (behavioral rules and use cases).

**Summary Answer:**  
The states of PEAS are the major operational scenarios it can be in during APS alignment and phasing activities. These states include Initializing, Calibration, Gravity Calibration, Get Reference Beam, Fine Tilt Alignment, M3 Alignment, Maintenance Alignment, Alignment 1µm Post-Segment Exchange, Self Test, StandBy, Taking Off-Axis Measurements, Warping, and Harness Influence Function Analysis. The PEAS state is modeled as a SysML Class [ID: _18_0_5_baa02e2_1461990581099_572979_175128], which structurally represents these states, while the documentation clarifies their operational meaning and the rule that PEAS only leaves a primary state upon an Abort signal, returning then to StandBy. This integration of model and documentation ensures a clear understanding of PEAS states and their role in the TMT APS system."

2. **Failure to Acquire Initial Guide Star**: 
   - If the initial guide star cannot be acquired, the system allows for adjustments to parameters such as flux and integration time. This flexibility is crucial for ensuring that the telescope can still achieve its observational goals even if the first attempt at acquiring a guide star fails. The ""Slew New Guide start(s)"" [ID: _18_5_3_f1d0357_1523057519101_349343_23183] action is an example of a behavior that may be invoked in such scenarios.

3. **Operational Sequences Requiring New Guide Stars**: 
   - During specific operational sequences, the guide star acquisition sequence may necessitate acquiring a new guide star if the current one is deemed unsuitable or if the telescope needs to realign. This is part of the overall strategy to ensure that the adaptive optics loops are closed effectively, which is vital for high-quality observations. The ""Guide Star Acquisition Sequences for WFOS observations"" [ID: _18_5_3_f1d0357_1523059359618_176336_24706] outlines the procedures involved in these operational sequences.
